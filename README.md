## What is this?

This is a course project from Term 1 of Udacity's Virtual Reality Nanodegree. If you want to check it out, you'll need a Mac with Xcode and Unity installed. It can be opened in Unity and built as an iOS app from there. Shoot me a note if you need more instruction.

## How long did it take

This took about a day of work, much of it was creating the maze in SketchUp. Then the logic took about 3 hours.
